      <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>
    <p>
      <p>  The text discusses various definitions of data visualization and its importance in getting insights from data before processing it into information. According to Card, Mackinlay, and Schneiderman (1999), it is the use of computer-supported and interactive graphical representations of the data in an effort to better comprehend it. Our role in being able to visually perceive the data however is also important. This is highlighted by Kirk (2012). He highlights that the process involves the exchange of information exchange between the messenger (where the data is coming from) and the message (the actual data). With this in mind, my understanding of the term data visualization refers to the process of representing data in graphical means that are supported by computer technologies. The main purpose of the process, it creating an easier-to-comprehend datasheet, and finding certain patterns that start forming. </p>
      <p>  As I touched upon before, this process is computer-supported and also states the importance of technology plays an important role here. Advancements and evolution in tech have significantly facilitated the process. For instance, although a bit more theoretical unless I am wrong the usage of AR and VR are being explored for their capabilities in facilitating data visualization. They offer a new perspective that can offer deeper insights and understanding. An example is medical researchers using VR to visualize complex biological data.
        Some of the multiple forms included in the text are Bar Charts, Pie charts, line graphs, histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, area charts and tree maps. They’re discussed individually further in detail. These are used in different areas, heatmaps for example, are often used in football games to detail the player’s movement, identifying hotspots (areas where they occupied the most during a match), and/or player performance evaluation. 
      </p>  
      <p>  The text also expands upon the 4 theories of preattentive processing in human perception: feature integration theory, texton theory, similarity theory, and guided search theory. 
        The Feature integration theory is one developed by Anne Treismann and Garry Gelade, suggesting that features are detected attentively but objects, are identified separately. Basically, preattentive processing is described as the almost instant or effortless identification of visual features without the need for focused attention. 
        Focused attention processing, on the other hand, involves the brain trying to find certain features or regions of interest to integrate the features detected in the preattentive stage. 
        The texton theory focuses on studying patterns and how the human system detects variations of specific order stats. Certain features detected in the early visual system are termed “textons”: elongated blobs, terminators and crossing of line segments. 
        The similarity theory proposes that preattentive processing is based on the similarity of visual features. Objects are grouped together by the human visual system based on their size, shape, color and other visual features. In a group of colored objects of different shapes for example, our preattentive processing will allow us to group objects together with similar shapes and colors,allowing us to identify the different clusters almost effortlessly. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        The Guided Search Theory suggests that preattentive processing is guided by attentional control from the top-down. The human visual system uses prior knowledge to guide attention to relevant features and objects.

    <p>
      <p> User Interface - 
        The presentation of the site, is in single-page form, with access to the different sections being the first thing the user sees when they land. Because the site is a single page, you only have to scroll down to get to the different sections. You can also click on the navbar buttons correlating with the different sections, leading to automatic scrolling to that section. All the different sections then contain the relevant content as well. 
        
      </p>  
      <p>
        User Experiece -
        The main reason I wanted to have the site and its content be all on a single page, was for the sake of consistency and flow. The example given in the Universal Principles of Design text, was that of a restaurant chain, and all the other chains having the same decorations, layout, and colors. This is promoted in a single scroll site with the same visual structure being used, creating cohesion and a unified experience. Now, this could similarly be achieved by having multiple pages, and still keeping the same structure all throughout. I still want to be able to do a bit more with the navigation. Adding certain effects could improve our visual storytelling and make the reading more engaging as well. I do however have to look out for the risk of information overload and clustering. Better use of negative space could be done to avoid this. In my initial designs of the wireframes, I had intended for the content to drop down and hide away on clicks when the user wants to use the information, as a way around this. I will also have to see how this structure works with the data. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        Visually, the site is quite simple. The plan was to use simple shapes and neutral colors. This makes for a more understandable and straightforward visual representation (Lidwell, Holden, & Butler,2010, 56). Using this will also allow me to easily make any changes to the color in the future if there’s a plan to do so, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of the design. The usage of these colors also goes hand in hand with creating a more accessible high-contrast design that reduces distractions. This practice unlocks a level of accessibility to the visually impaired as well. 
        </p>    
      <P>
        I also noted that I decided to use text all throughout instead of any more graphical icons and components. On second notice, this might not be a very good thing to do. The positives of this being clarity, and being able to broadly describe the information to the reader. One of the negatives is the potential for reduced accessibility, particularly for people who might not understand the language. This correlates with Viktor Papanek’s idea, of design also thinking about people of other cultures, and being for people (Papanek, 1985). We can use graphical icons in place of the text. They have the advantage of being more recognizable, going past the barriers of the language, and being more inclusive.

      <h2>Blog Post 3</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>Text Notes</h3>
          The text introduces the importance of data visualization. Interaction is described as the graphical representation of information. It’s the process of representing complex data in a visual form to facilitate exploration and communication. Interaction in data visualization has lacked a clear definition. It’s been a challenging concept to define, both in HCI and data visualization. Defining it has come with technical challenges in HCI. Interaction occurs at all stages of the process in the visualization pipeline (Dimara & Perin, 2020). In their attempt to find a definition for visualization, a questionnaire was sent out to people within the HCI community. They had experience ranging from 5 to 30 years. A critical review approach, to identify relevant papers was used, with various tags also used to categorize the papers. These included “Definition of interaction”, “Benefits of Interaction” etc. 
        </p>
          <p>
          The term is described as overloaded and complex. The next step was to synthesize a definition, by looking at 32 different papers, and their attempts at describing it. The core components and entities (external and internal) are revealed. The two most cited mandatory external entities are the user and the data. There’s also mention of external and internal actions. External actions include actions that change the data, while internal actions take the form of a dialogue between the internal representations and processes of the user and the eternal representations (Dimara & Parin, 2020).  The limited flexibility in the field of user visualization overall is highlighted, with more emphasis needed for more adaptable systems. These should go beyond just traditional data analysis goals and accommodate a broader spectrum. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Interaction is seen as a cycle of communication acts, involving input and output from both the user and the computer perspectives. Good interaction maximizes directness and provides a strong sense of understanding and control. The seven concepts of interaction, namely, Dialogue, transmission, control, tool use, optimal behavior, embodiment, and experience. These provide a foundation for understanding interaction in the context of HCI. The concepts could also be used to extend the field of visualization. Both HCI and visualization consider user intent, but the former mostly aims for general-purpose tools. The latter could benefit from looking at potential future user goals. Visualization also only considers a well-defined user, instead of a wider range of user profiles. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The key differences between visualization and Human-Computer Interaction lie in the entities involved, focus on facilitating knowledge construction and sense-making in VIS compared to HCI’s emphasis on ease of use and performance. Finally, we are given a short and compact definition of interaction, all within the context of visualization of course. It “is the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such” (2020). Interaction is central to data visualization. It involves a process of exploration, manipulation, and discovery within an interface. This applies to various scenarios, in its attempt to demonstrate its effectiveness in delineating interaction in different contexts. The definition should be mainly actionable within the data interfaces. Flexibility in this context relates to a “number of distinct, allowable actions of a person on the interface, as well as the number of interactions means with which the person can perform each action” (2020, p9). This makes it possible to describe and compare data interfaces.  
        </p>

        <p>
          The text smartly also discusses the challenges that could come with this. Simply increasing allowable interactions doesn’t necessarily lead to better interaction quality. The associated costs and the need to specify boundaries in interaction design are also discussed. Despite all of this, the definition in the end is still said to not capture all perspectives of interaction. Certain parts of the interaction directness and user engagement were also left out of the text, due to a lack of expert input. But even more importantly, in my opinion, the low number of responses overall, should not be overlooked. With only 35% responding, we do have to be mindful of the bias that might come towards the more senior researchers. Now as we’ve already stated, the scope of the definition does not cover every single field. The lack of cover from practitioners and professionals takes away the needed information from a more realistic and functioning methodology that is being put to work. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, The text broadly goes across this, the importance of finding a clear framework of interaction that can apply both for visualization and HCI. As already mentioned, it allows for the facilitation of understanding and communication, enabling users to engage with data in an easier manner. The biggest issue, however, is still the low number of respondents. While I understand that there was bound to be fewer respondents than expected, a higher number of more than 50% would’ve given more information to base their framework. Lastly, the focus almost exclusively on academics and theory, also somewhat loses credibility. We are unable to get a scope of how this definition relates to the real world if this makes any sense. This also interplays with the aforementioned problem with a much lower scope being used.

        <h2>Blog Post 4</h2>
      <p>
        I didn’t quite have too many ideas on what I wanted to achieve with the data art. I started by looking at examples of proper data art, and what it can be used for. The first I looked at was the “Information is Beautiful website consisting of stats about different data structures from different categories, one of them being the “Hollywood Hits & Flops(2023)”. As the name suggests, it makes a graph of the biggest Hollywood films of the year, then places them in areas of the map depending on their gross for the year as well as whether they’re worth watching or not. I thought overall a lot of the examples they had on the site were good. 

      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, I thought about my data set and what I could do with it. I used location data points initially, but wasn’t exactly too sure what I could do about it. At first, I wanted to have the site be interactive with the data points and different images captured at those specific data points. The first route was to change my data structure to something else.

      </p>
      
      <p>
        The alternative API I used was of the Exoplanet API, to create visualizations of the models and make the data more understandable. The art will be visualizing the exoplanets orbits within their star systems, and using the data to depict them.  As I had previously said, trying to take inspiration from some examples in the Information is beautiful website.
