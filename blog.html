      <h2>Blog </h2>
    <p>
      <p>  The text discusses various definitions of data visualization and its importance in getting insights from data before processing it into information. According to Card, Mackinlay, and Schneiderman (1999), it is the use of computer-supported and interactive graphical representations of the data in an effort to better comprehend it. Our role in being able to visually perceive the data however is also important. This is highlighted by Kirk (2012). He highlights that the process involves the exchange of information exchange between the messenger (where the data is coming from) and the message (the actual data). With this in mind, my understanding of the term data visualization refers to the process of representing data in graphical means that are supported by computer technologies. The main purpose of the process, it creating an easier-to-comprehend datasheet, and finding certain patterns that start forming. </p>
      <p>  As I touched upon before, this process is computer-supported and also states the importance of technology plays an important role here. Advancements and evolution in tech have significantly facilitated the process. For instance, although a bit more theoretical unless I am wrong the usage of AR and VR are being explored for their capabilities in facilitating data visualization. They offer a new perspective that can offer deeper insights and understanding. An example is medical researchers using VR to visualize complex biological data.
        Some of the multiple forms included in the text are Bar Charts, Pie charts, line graphs, histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, area charts and tree maps. They’re discussed individually further in detail. These are used in different areas, heatmaps for example, are often used in football games to detail the player’s movement, identifying hotspots (areas where they occupied the most during a match), and/or player performance evaluation. 
      </p>  
      <p>  The text also expands upon the 4 theories of preattentive processing in human perception: feature integration theory, texton theory, similarity theory, and guided search theory. 
        The Feature integration theory is one developed by Anne Treismann and Garry Gelade, suggesting that features are detected attentively but objects, are identified separately. Basically, preattentive processing is described as the almost instant or effortless identification of visual features without the need for focused attention. 
        Focused attention processing, on the other hand, involves the brain trying to find certain features or regions of interest to integrate the features detected in the preattentive stage. 
        The texton theory focuses on studying patterns and how the human system detects variations of specific order stats. Certain features detected in the early visual system are termed “textons”: elongated blobs, terminators and crossing of line segments. 
        The similarity theory proposes that preattentive processing is based on the similarity of visual features. Objects are grouped together by the human visual system based on their size, shape, color and other visual features. In a group of colored objects of different shapes for example, our preattentive processing will allow us to group objects together with similar shapes and colors,allowing us to identify the different clusters almost effortlessly. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        The Guided Search Theory suggests that preattentive processing is guided by attentional control from the top-down. The human visual system uses prior knowledge to guide attention to relevant features and objects.

      <h2>Blog 2 </h2>
    <p>
      <p> User Interface - 
        The presentation of the site, is in single-page form, with access to the different sections being the first thing the user sees when they land. Because the site is a single page, you only have to scroll down to get to the different sections. You can also click on the navbar buttons correlating with the different sections, leading to automatic scrolling to that section. All the different sections then contain the relevant content as well. 
        
      </p>  
      <p>
        User Experiece -
        The main reason I wanted to have the site and its content be all on a single page, was for the sake of consistency and flow. The example given in the Universal Principles of Design text, was that of a restaurant chain, and all the other chains having the same decorations, layout, and colors. This is promoted in a single scroll site with the same visual structure being used, creating cohesion and a unified experience. Now, this could similarly be achieved by having multiple pages, and still keeping the same structure all throughout. I still want to be able to do a bit more with the navigation. Adding certain effects could improve our visual storytelling and make the reading more engaging as well. I do however have to look out for the risk of information overload and clustering. Better use of negative space could be done to avoid this. In my initial designs of the wireframes, I had intended for the content to drop down and hide away on clicks when the user wants to use the information, as a way around this. I will also have to see how this structure works with the data. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        Visually, the site is quite simple. The plan was to use simple shapes and neutral colors. This makes for a more understandable and straightforward visual representation (Lidwell, Holden, & Butler,2010, 56). Using this will also allow me to easily make any changes to the color in the future if there’s a plan to do so, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of the design. The usage of these colors also goes hand in hand with creating a more accessible high-contrast design that reduces distractions. This practice unlocks a level of accessibility to the visually impaired as well. 
        </p>    
      <P>
        I also noted that I decided to use text all throughout instead of any more graphical icons and components. On second notice, this might not be a very good thing to do. The positives of this being clarity, and being able to broadly describe the information to the reader. One of the negatives is the potential for reduced accessibility, particularly for people who might not understand the language. This correlates with Viktor Papanek’s idea, of design also thinking about people of other cultures, and being for people (Papanek, 1985). We can use graphical icons in place of the text. They have the advantage of being more recognizable, going past the barriers of the language, and being more inclusive.
